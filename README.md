During this project, I focused on creating my first virtual machine in VirtualBox. 
The goal was to follow specific instructions and set up my own operating system while following strict rules. 
Along the way, I learned how to install various tools like SSH, UFW
Mariadb, as well as manage user groups and schedule cron jobs.
